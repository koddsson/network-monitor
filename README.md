# network-monitor

A simple network monitor using the [Network Information API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API).

My internet at home would drop randomly one day and I wanted to see if there's a good way to monitor the network. I'll leave this page running in a Chrome window all day and then I can check it if my network is wonky.
